Tech Industry Employability Prediction & Analysis

Objective: Developed a Machine Learning model to predict employability status for IT professionals based on the StackOverflow dataset.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Random Forest, SHAP (Explainable AI), Matplotlib, Seaborn.

Key Contributions:

Performed comprehensive data cleaning and pre-processing on a dataset of over 70,000 records, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key correlations between employability and factors such as age, education level, and specific technical skills.

Built and optimized a Random Forest Classifier to accurately categorize employment status.

Integrated SHAP Values to interpret model decisions, identifying that proficiency in Web Development (Node.js, JavaScript) and Database Management (SQL) were the primary drivers for employment opportunities in the tech sector.
